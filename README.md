# NSAVP

**NOTE: the dataset, documentation, and software toolkit are still under development. The currently released sample data is intended to facilitate an understanding of the data format and initial algorithm development. If you are interested in the dataset check back and/or Watch the repository on GitHub for updates. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) will be updated to record changes since the initial release.**

This repository contains documentation and software tools for the Novel Sensors for Autonomous Vehicle Perception (NSAVP) dataset, introduced for the [IROS 2023 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/novelsensors2023) of the same name. The data is available for download on [Deep Blue Data](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/collections/v118rf157).

Additional information is available in the following documentation files:
- [Sensors](documentation/sensors.md): Description of the sensor suite.
- [Data Format](documentation/data_format.md): Description of the data collected and the data format.
- Conversion (coming soon): Guide to convert the data from H5 to ROS1 rosbag and back.
- Visualization (coming soon): Guide to visualize the data.
- Preprocessing (coming soon): Guide to perform preprocessing operations (e.g., cropping, debayering, rectification) on the data.
- Place Recognition (coming soon): Tutorial for evaluating a place recognition method on the dataset.

If you have any questions or comments, please create a GitHub issue.
